#Color Guessing Game

##What is the Color Guessing Game?

This is a simple game where you need to choose the correct colored square(6 squares on Hard/3 squares on easy) based on a random RGB value.
If you fail to choose the correct squares, they will fade out until there is only the correct square left.
